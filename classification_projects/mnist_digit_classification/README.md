# Digit Classification using the MNIST Dataset

This project uses Tensorflow to build and train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to make predictions on images of 
28 x 28 pixels that contain some unclassified digits. The task of the model is to successfully predict which digit is 
present in each image. To accomplish this, the CNN is trained with a dataset that contains both the pixel values and the 
corresponding labels (numbers)
